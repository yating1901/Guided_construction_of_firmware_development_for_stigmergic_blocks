# Guided_construction_of_firmware_development_for_stigmergic_blocks

This firmware code is developed for the guided construction with smart strucure.
In this code, the stigmergic blocks are able to switch color according to the construction state.
There might be more than one root block in the structure, assembled by more than one BuilderBot.
